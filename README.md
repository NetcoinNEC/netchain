## Features

- **Consensus Mechanisms**: Implements Proof of Stake (PoS) and Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) with Verifiable Random Function (VRF).
- **Cryptography**: Utilizes post-quantum cryptographic algorithms including CRYSTALS-Kyber, Dilithium, and SPHINCS+.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Supports zk-SNARK and zk-STARK functionalities for enhanced privacy.
- **Dynamic Sharding**: Implements dynamic shard creation and encrypted cross-shard messaging.
- **Governance**: Features a reputation-based voting mechanism.
- **Security**: Includes AI-driven anomaly detection and federated learning capabilities.

## Testing

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm run test
```
